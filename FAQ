Q01: I tried to add a User for getting Op from psyBNC with /ADDOP.
     He tried /msg bouncer op password, but it did not work ! What is wrong ?

A01: A question to psyBNC for op has always to include the channel.
     So if a user asks for op, he has to do:
     /msg bouncer op password #channel
     to get op.

Q02: How to use the internal network?
A02: Edit the config.h and insert "#define INTNET" recompile the psyBNC. done.

Q03: How do quit psyBNC?
A03: Type /bquit (~networkprefix) to quit your irc sessions. To kill the psyBNC you have to kill the process id.

Q03: How to change my CTCP VERSION reply?
A03: Edit the config.h and insert "#define CTCPVERSION "my own ctcp reply" recompile the psyBNC. done.

Q04: I try to compile psyBNC and get this error:
     This needs the ncurses library. If it is not available, menuconf wont work.
     If you are using curses, use make menuconfig-curses instead.
     make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
     What should i do?

A04: Install ncurses. Easy going. apt-get install ncurses or ask rpmfind for the package.

Q05: I added a friend to my bouncer but he can't connect. The bouncer says 
     "WRONG PASSWORD" although i did check the password and it's correct !
     A05: Bouncer login is completed from two parts. One is LOGIN NAME other is PASSWORD.
     If you do a /ADDUSER, then the first parameter of ADDUSER isn't the nick, but
     the ident field.
     Both must be correct in order to succesfully LOG-IN ! In mIRC you must set the 
     IDENT to the name that you are edded in bouncer. But be carefull ! Sometimes in 
     IRC the ident doesn't work right. So you must also set E-MAIL ADDRESS to that name.

Q06: I use bouncer but i can't DCC CHAT or SEND. What is wrong ?
A06: In mIRC you should change the settings under LOCAL INFO -> LOOKUP METHOD to NORMAL. 
     You should also make sure that you have ON CONNECT ALWAYS GET: Local host & IP checked.

Q07: I connected my bouncer to BounceNet. But then i had to reinstall it. Now it won't 
     connect again even if i added the /LINKTO correctly.

A07: The link must be added again on BOTH sides. Bouncer uses a verification which was 
     deleted when you reinstalled bouncer. Just make sure the ADMIN on the other side 
     adds your bouncer again.

Q08: I have added a BOT DCC to my bouncer. It worked great. Now it's gone. What sould i do ?
A08: Problems like this or simmilar always use REHASH. Warning ! This will close your connection.

Q09: My bouncer is active but not on the IRC NETWORK. When i do /bconnect it says: 
     "You are not marked as quitted." What to do?
A09: Check the server that you have added. Check that the IRC server in ServerList 
     allows connection from that host. If both is verified then the reason is possibly 
     this. Your bouncer got disconnected from IRC by some error. Use /BQUIT to mark 
     it as quitted then use /BCONNECT again 

Q10: Is there a way to get psyBNC to send you dcc files (recieve) directly to you and not to the shell?
A10: Yes, /dccenable 0

Q11: I set bouncer so that it asks OP from a bot. I am added in bot and i checked my 
     password. But nothing happens. What is wrong ?
A11: Usually eggdrops have a general command used to gain OPs . It's 
     /MSG BotName OP password. In your case the bot might have different command to 
     ask OPs from. Bouncer can only ask OPs the normal way.

Q11: I would like to suggest a Bugfix/Change to psyBNC. Whom should i ask ?
A12: Visit http://www.psyBNC.info/development.html and use the contact eMails.

Q13: How to install psyBNC?
A13: At first download the latest source. 
     wget http://www.psychoid.lam3rz.de/psyBNC2.3.1.tar.gz
     Extract the source with 'tar -xzf psyBNC2.3.1.tar.gz'
     Now type 'cd psyBNC'.
     Edit the 'psyBNC.conf' or create it with "menuconfig" but at first you have to compile it
     with 'make menuconfig'.

     Configuration example:

     Listening ports - On which port should the psyBNC listen?
     Links - Not needed yet.
     Bouncer Name - Name your Bouncer. Something like 'MyBouncer' works fine.
     Host Allows - To allow anyone set this to '*'.
     Users - Add yourself..
     DCC Host - The IP to use for all DCC sessions (if you enabled DCC support). Recommend setting is the same IP that your bnc use.

     Setup is complete. Compile your bouncer with "make" in your psyBNC directory. Type './psyBNC' to start.

Q14: How to setup a crontab for psyBNC? (10 minutes interval automatic start/restart if psyBNC isn't running)
A14: Edit the psyBNCchk file, that the follow path points to the right dir. 
     psyBNCPATH=/home/user/psyBNC
     Edit the crontab with:
     'crontab -e' and insert "0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/foobar/psyBNCchk >/dev/null 2>&1"
     Go on with 'chmod 700 psyBNCchk' for the right permissions.
     The ">/dev/null 2>&1" part tells crontab not to send you an eMmail whenever it restarts psyBNC.

Q15: How to use psyBNC with oidentd?

A15: 1. Installation:

You can install odidentd with an rpm or download the source code and compile it by yourself. 

a) rpm installation

First change to the desired directory and download the rpm package:
wget http://url.to/oident.tgz

now install the rpm:
rpm -Uhv oidentd-2.0.4-2.i386.rpm

If everything runs configure oidentd and psyBNC.
Now you should stop the old identd daemon: killall -9 identd
Afterwards you should by means of: /etc/init.d/oidentd start start oidentd. 
Delete the entries of the old identd daemons if these are still present.

b) source (tar.gz) installation

First you should if not already done, download the newest version of oidentd.
Changes for example to your gome directory and enter:
wget http://belnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ojnk/oidentd-2.0.4.tar.gz 

Now you should extract the package:tar -xzvf oidentd-2.0.5.tar.gz
and change to the extracted directory: cd oidentd-2.0.4
Now its time to configure and make the oidentd:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
and as root: make install 

If you receive any error after the ./configure --prefix=/usr step, your system may miss some packages. 
In most cases you'll need these packages (they are for an i386 system and should work on most linux distributions, 
if they dont go to rpmfind.net and search for the packages yourself):

flex -> ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.3/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/flex-2.5.4a-23.i386.rpm
bison -> ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.3/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/bison-1.35-1.i386.rpm
byacc -> ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.3/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/byacc-1.9-19.i386.rpm

to install them, type "wget ftp://path/file.rpm" and "rpm -Uhv file.rpm"

Oidentd should correct installed now and the you should stop the old inetd deamons with: killall -9 identd
In order to examine the correct installation, you should check whether if the file /usr/sbin/oidentd exists.
If it exists, everything was correctly. 

2. Configuration of oidentd:

After you successfully installed oidentd, it will be necessary to configure a few things.
If not yet available the file /etc/oidentd.conf would be created and opened with an editor like vi or mcedit.
Make sure, that the file is created in unix text mode and not in dos text mode, else you'll get a error when trying
to start oidentd later, that says something like "can't read configuration file" or "error in configuration file". 
In order to permit each bouncer user to get his own ident, change the /etc/oidentd.conf as follows and make sure that
it can be read by any user. To ensure this, type: chmod 644 /etc/oidentd.conf
In order to permit that each bouncer user gets his own ident, change the /etc/oidentd.conf as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for oidentd
# see oidentd.conf(5)
#
default {
default {
allow spoof
allow spoof_all
allow spoof_privport
allow random
allow random_numeric
allow numeric
allow hide
}
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Configuration of psyBNC:

So that psyBNC work together with oidentd, you must activate the oidentd support for psyBNC.
This can be realized either by make menuconfig, or however manually, editing the file config.h and insert into a free line:
#define OIDENTD
Afterwards you must recompile psyBNC. All psyBNC passwords would become invalid.
To prevent from this use the following method: 1. You need a copy of salt.h - you can provide with: cp salt.h salt.bak

4. You need a copy of its psyBNC.conf - you can provide with: cp psyBNC.conf psyBNC.bak

It applies to provide both copies before the recompilation. If the file salt.h was moved or renamed,
you must copy it back to the psyBNC directory and rename it in salt.h.
Afterwards you could execute carelessly make. After make is finished, you must retransfer psyBNC.bak and
rename in psyBNC.conf. cp psyBNC.bak psyBNC.conf Now psyBNC has oidentd support and you lost no passwords. 
Now you can start oidentd manually and examine if the idents are correctly indicated:
/usr/sbin/oidentd -m -u nobody -g nogroup

Q16: How to add an IPV6 IP on psyBNC?
A16: type /BVHOST "2001:your:ip":6667

Q17: I just installed my psyBNC and connected to it, but i get this message:
     " -- psyBNC- WARNING ! Move the file salt.h from the shell to a safe place"
A17: Logon to your shell, type "cd psybnc" and "rm salt.h". 

Q18: I forgot my password or need a new one.
A19: If your have shell access goto the psybnc dir and replace your password in the psybnc.conf with a plaintext password.

Q20: My bouncer is connecting to servers that i dont want it to, how can i solve that?
A20: The reason this is happening is because you have added more than one server into your bouncers config.
     When your bouncer splits from the irc network you are on it trys to recconect to the server, 
     if it can't and you have another network in your list it will simple try that one.
     To find out what servers you have in your server list type /LISTSERVERS on your bouncer,
     to delete them simply type /DELSERVER (server number).

Q21: I am getting a message when i logon to my bouncer from Q bot saying 'you are already authed' 
A21: When you first login to your bnc it takes your auth details and auths the bot so to speak.
     From this moment on you are permently authed on your bouncer and there is no need to auth everytime you connect.
     The reason you get the message is due to your Qnet auth still being in your irc clients perform list.
     To get rid of the message simple remove it from your perform list . (please ensure you keep your auth details safe)


Q22: How to add an IPV6 ip to the server list?
A22: Type /ADDSERVER "2001:server:ip":6667


Q23: How to handle psyBNC with SSL Links?
A23: Type on SSL Host /linkfrom remote :remotehost.com:<non-ssl-port> 
     and type on SSL Client /linkto server :S=serverhost.com<ssl-port>
     
Q24: Is it possible set psyBNC to cycle on empty and opless channel?
A24: No.

Q25: How do I set a vhost for a secondary network?
A25: Type /BVHOST netprefix~your.vhost.com

Q26: Is it possible to make a psyBNC that doesnt use crypted password?
A26: Yes, use the source, luke. 

Q27: Is there any way to reset all user connections?
A27: Yes, type /BREHASH

Q28: How to add an IPv6 Server?
A28: Type /ADDSERVER "
